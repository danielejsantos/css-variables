# CSS Variables and JS

### #JavaScript30

This is the third of the 30 day Vanilla [JS Challenge](http://https://javascript30.com/ "JS Challenge") by Wes Bos. On today's challenge, I implemented CSS variables that can be dynamically updated with JavaScript, like blur the image, change the image border color, and increase/decrease spacing.

The **technologies** used:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
